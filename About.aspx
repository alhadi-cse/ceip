        The Government of Bangladesh obtained a Credit of US$ 375 million from the International Development Association (IDA) and a Grant of US$ 25 million from the Climate Investment Fund (CIF) to finance the cost of the Coastal Embankment Improvement Project-Phase I (CEIP-I). The objective of the investment is to rehabilitate polder embankments and strengthen their long-term durability through heightened embankment, improved drainage, and foreshore afforestation. 

While investments over the last 50 years usually addressed damage caused by previous disasters, CEIP is the first comprehensive program to address flooding and storm surge risk strategically. CEIP is expected to be implemented in three Phases over a 20-year period. Phase I will cover 17 polders in six coastal districts – Khulna, Bagerhat, Satkhira, Patuakhali, Barguna and Pirojpur. 
The project development objectives as approved and agreed upon by the World Bank and GoB are to: 


    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) increase the area protected in selected polders from tidal flooding, salinity intrusion and frequent storm surges, which are expected to worsen due to climate change;



        </li>
        <li>(b) improve agricultural production by reducing saline water intrusion in selected polders; and 
        </li>
        <li>(c) improve the Government of Bangladesh’s capacity to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency.”
